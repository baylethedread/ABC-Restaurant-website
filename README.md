# ABC Restaurant Web Application

## Overview

The **ABC Restaurant Web Application** is an interactive, database-driven platform developed for the **ABC Restaurant** chain, a popular restaurant group located across various cities in Sri Lanka. The application is designed to help the restaurant enhance its operations by providing a seamless web-based platform for managing reservations, customer queries, and facilitating services for different user types: **Admins**, **Staff**, and **Customers**.

  - **Staff**: Manages reservations, processes payments, and responds to customer queries.
  - **Customer**: Makes reservations, submits queries, and tracks their service history.

## System Architecture

The application follows a multi-tiered architecture with a focus on modularity and maintainability:

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JSP** to provide a responsive and interactive experience.
- **Backend**: Developed using **Java Servlets** and **RESTful Web Services** to handle business logic, data transactions, and communication between the frontend and backend systems.
- **Database**: **MySQL** is used as the backend database to store all user, reservation, and query data, with structured relationships between entities.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates the application's data, business logic, and presentation layers for better organization and code management.
  - **Singleton**: Manages database connections to ensure efficient resource handling.
  - **Factory Pattern**: Provides abstraction for object creation, enhancing scalability and modularity.

## Web Services

The application is built as a **distributed system** with multiple web services responsible for:

- **User Management**: Services for creating, updating, and deleting users.
- **Reservation Service**: Handles new reservations, checking availability, and reservation history.
- **Query Service**: Manages customer queries and staff responses.

These web services handle communication between the frontend and the backend, ensuring a smooth flow of data across the application.

## Database Design

The system uses a **MySQL** relational database, structured to handle:

- **Users**: Stores information for Admins, Staff, and Customers, including login credentials and roles.
- **Reservations**: Tracks all customer reservations for different services (dine-in, takeaway, delivery).
- **Queries**: Stores customer queries submitted via the website and records staff responses.

(Include a database diagram here that visually explains the relationships between entities such as Users, Reservations, Queries.)

# Project Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project uses **IntelliJ IDEA** as the IDE, **Java** for backend development, and **XAMPP** for managing the MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or above)
2. **IntelliJ IDEA** (Ultimate or Community Edition)
3. **XAMPP** (Apache + MySQL)
4. **Git** (optional but recommended for version control)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

## Step 2: Import the Project into IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Go to **File > Open** and select the cloned project folder.
3. IntelliJ will automatically detect the project structure and import it.
4. Set the **JDK** if required:
   - Go to **File > Project Structure > Project**.
   - Set the **Project SDK** to your installed JDK version.

## Step 3: Set Up XAMPP for MySQL

1. Start **XAMPP** and activate **Apache** and **MySQL**.
2. Open **phpMyAdmin** at [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
3. Import the provided `.sql` file:
   - In **phpMyAdmin**, go to the **Import** tab.
   - Select the `.sql` file from your project folder and click **Go**.
5. Update database credentials in the project configuration 

## Step 4: Running the Project

Once the project is set up and the database is configured, you can run the application:

1. **Build the project**:
   - In IntelliJ, go to the top toolbar and click on the green **Run** button or press `Shift + F10` to build and run the application.
   
2. **Access the application**:
   - Once the application starts successfully, open a web browser.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.

3. **Verify Database Connection**:
   - Ensure that your XAMPP server is running with **Apache** and **MySQL**.
   - Check that the application connects to the database by visiting different parts of the application (e.g., creating a user, making a reservation).

4. **Common Endpoints**:
   - Admin Dashboard: `http://localhost:8080/admin`
   - User Registration: `http://localhost:8080/register`
